    """
    DGL-LifeSci provides built-in support for constructing three kinds of graphs for molecules – molecular graphs,
    distance-based graphs, and complete graphs.

    Edges in a molecular graph correspond to chemical bounds, while every pair of atoms is connected in a complete
    graph. As for a distance-based graph, an edge between a pair of atoms is constructed if the distance between them
    is within a cutoff distance.

    Generated graphs must be fed into DGL-constructed GNNs for further operation.
